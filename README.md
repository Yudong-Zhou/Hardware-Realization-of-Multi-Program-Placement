### UCLA ECE Course M216A Project: Hardware Realization of Multi-Program Placement

**Group Members:** Zepeng Lin, Haoxuan Xia, Yudong Zhou

#### Motivation:
Consider a compute array (128x128) and a stream of incoming programs with varying widths and heights, both ranging from 4 to 16. We use a heuristic algorithm that places the incoming  program onto the compute array. The goal is to come up with a power- and area-efficient  implementation of the given algorithm, subject to the processing latency constraints.

#### Project Statement:
Implement the assigned program allocation algorithm using minimum area and power, taking precisely 8 clock cycles of signal processing latency at the top level.
